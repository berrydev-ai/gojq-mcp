gojq-mcp is a dual-mode JSON query tool that operates as both an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server and a standalone CLI executable, utilizing jq syntax via the gojq library. It enables executing jq queries on JSON files with comprehensive validation for file existence, readability, and JSON validity. The project features a well-tested core with 14 test cases, supports multiple transport modes (stdio, HTTP, SSE), and provides zero-configuration operation. Built in Go, it integrates seamlessly with MCP clients like Claude Desktop while offering planned CLI functionality for direct command-line usage.
